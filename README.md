# Python Crash Course
A collection of simple python scripts covering Python programming concepts. 

## Setting Up
Edited 30 April 2022: My current personal combination is Python 3.10.4 on my Windows 10 laptop. Install the latest Python version from [https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3104/] and add it to path. Tip: tick the ‘add to path’ box when installing. Then verify in cmd with the python command.

```

Create the first file and execute from command line: Use any text editor, for example, Notepad, to create a new file. Name the file ‘helloworld.py’, write the following line in it, and save it.
```python
print('Hello World!')
```
To execute or run the script, open cmd, navigate to the folder or directory where the helloworld.py file is saved and run the script using the python command.
```
C:\Users\Wafaa QUL\Documents\writings\python\code>python helloworld.py
Hello World!
```
Other text editors or integrated development environments can be used to create and manage python scripts. For example, IDLE, Notepad++, PyCharm, etc…
